# Playerok Admin Panel Rewrite

This project is a rewrite of a media player mini PC admin panel. It's built using modern web technologies including React and Vite to provide a better user experience and improved maintainability.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Vite
- Modern CSS

## Development
To run the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Debugging in VS Code
This project includes VS Code launch configurations for debugging. You can debug the application in several ways:

1. **Debug in Chrome**: 
   - Start the development server (`npm run dev`)
   - Press F5 or select "Launch Chrome against localhost" from the debug menu
   - VS Code will launch Chrome and attach the debugger

2. **Debug Vite Dev Server**:
   - Select "Debug Vite Dev Server" from the debug menu
   - This will start the Vite dev server with debugging enabled

3. **Full Stack Debug**:
   - Select "Debug Full Stack" from the debug menu
   - This will launch both the Vite dev server and Chrome with debugging enabled

You can set breakpoints directly in VS Code, inspect variables, and use the debug console while debugging. The source maps are properly configured for accurate debugging of the React components.
